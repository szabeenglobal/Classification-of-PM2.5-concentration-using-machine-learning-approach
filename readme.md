## Classification of PM2.5 concentration using machine learning approach Google Colab link is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1__UHk7F9gGWpOvjv1G5mj6nBv-XVNn9Q?usp=sharing)
In this project, we tested 5 different machine learning classification models to find out the best performing model for classifying PM 2.5 concentration levels. 

Particulate matters or PM are non gaseous compounds and elements that can be found suspended in the air. Some of the PMs are toxix and hazardous. PM10 and PM2.5 refer to the particulate matter smaller than 10 and 2.5 microns in diameters respectively. High concentration or long term exposure of these toxic elements is a major public health concern.

Exposure to PMs was found to be associated with serios health condition including cardiovascular disease, respiratory symptoms, diabetes, morbidity, mortatilty and others. In 2008, it is estimated that the average reduction in life expectancy of UK residents as a result of long term exposure to PM2.5 is months. In that year alone, it was estimated that 29,000 people lost their lives early due to PM2.5 exposure 1. In the following year, 7% of total death in UK was associated air pollution.

Only cardiovascular disease cost the UK economy Â£29.1 billion in 2004. 60% of this cost was accounted to health 2. Due to significantly adverse public health threat that PM2.5 poses it is going to be benificial for people to have access to an automatic prediction system that will alert if the PM2.5 concentration is above a certain level. Current PM2.5 air quality banding system and proposed classification is discussed in the following paragraphs.
